Dizziness is one of the most common symptoms in medicine. For differentiation of peripheral or central origin of the vertigo, history and clinical examination with detection of a nystagmus is essential. The aim of this study was to detect horizontal vestibular nystagmus utilizing a webcam. In the feasibility study, caloric induced vestibular nystagmus was recorded with conventional video-nystagmography and webcam. Analysis of recorded data was performed with a developed software which used computer vision techniques. A designed algorithm detected nystagmus existence and their direction. The software was evaluated by an expert-rated video-nystagmography. Webcam-based vestibular nystagmus detection is possible. Currently, a clinical application is not approved. Further software improvements are necessary to increase its accuracy.
