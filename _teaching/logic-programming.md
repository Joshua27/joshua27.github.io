In imperative programming languages, programs are represented as sequences of instructions. In logic programming, one describes the solution for a problem as facts and rules instead of writing an algorithm. The computer then finds a solution autonomously. This offers a new and radically different point of view towards programming, useful even for the every day programmer using C or Java.

The lecture covers the following topics:
- Propositional and predicate logic
- Resolution
- First-order logic
- Programming using horn clauses
- Basics of Prolog
- Constraint logic programming
- SAT solving

I prepared and graded weekly exercise sheets and gave a weekly tutorial on logic programming. Further, I prepared and graded exams and held an annual lecture on constraint logic programming.

I was involved in teaching this course for 8 years from 2015 until 2023.
